# Tetris
Tetris game written in Python 3.7 using the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) library.

I made this to show that I actually learned something from my first foray into the world of Python. And also for my own entertainment. Tetris is fun.

# How to play
Install Python and Pygame. Instructions for installing Pygame can be found at the [Getting Started page](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted).

Open the file named Tetris.pyw and enjoy the game.

Keybindings:
- `Enter`: Does different things like selecting an option from the start menu, pausing the game, and returning to the start screen after you reach the game over screen.
- `Up`: Rotates the block clockwise.
- `Down`: Moves the block downwards.
- `Left`: Moves the block to the left.
- `Right`: Moves the block to the right.
- `Z`: Rotates the block counter clockwise.
- `X`: Rotates the block clockwise.
